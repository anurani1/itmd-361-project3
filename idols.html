      <h2>Some Stage Choreographies I Like</h2>
      <p>One of my interests is idols; I enjoy a lot of the music produced by idol groups, as well as the effort that goes into the performances. One of the aspects of a good performance is the choreography. Here are some I like!</p>

      <h3>Antifragile - Le Sserafim</h3>
      <img src="media/antifragile_showcase.webp" alt="antifragile stage photo">
      <p>This choreography is very smooth!! All of Le Sserafim's tracks have such insane advanced choreography. They are amazing performers to watch.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, anyway.</p>

    <h3>Kitsch - IVE</h3>
    <img src="media/kitsch_showcase.jpg" alt="kitsch stage photo">
    <p>Again, I really like smooth choreography! Plus, the artists look like they're genuinely enjoying themselves and their performance. Bonus points for cool jackets.</p>

    <h3>Pirate - Everglow</h3>
    <img src="media/everglow_showcase.jpg" alt="everglow stage photo">
    <p>Not only is the song addicting, there is a very addicting dance to go along with it. Women are so cool.</p>
    </section>
    
    <p><em>These opinions are my own and the reader is under no obligation to agree. However, I think everyone should agree that women are pretty cool.</em></p>
