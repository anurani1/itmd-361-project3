      <h2>MUSIC</h2>
      <p><strong>Now or Never Now : Metric</strong></p>
      <p>A very close friend of mine introduced the "Art of Doubt" album to me, and I give it significant importance because of that. Metric has a very nice sound; this song reminds me of peace.</p>
      <p><strong>Vacation Town : The Front Bottoms</strong></p>
      <p>Having listened to this band for over 6 years, I can confidently say I will never get tired of this song! There is an incredibly nostalgic tone with the chorus and I enjoy listening to it when I'd like to think of good experiences.</p>
      <p><strong>Love Words IV : Deco*27</strong></p>
      <p>This song is very important to me! It shares a similar tone of nostalgia; the lyrics express comfort and was released by the author as an expression of appreciation for his listeners throughout the span of his career.</p>

      <h2>GAMES</h2>
      <p><strong>Detroit : Become Human</strong></p>
      <p>When I finished this game in 2019, I discovered key aspects of what truly makes a good game. I was captivated by the story behind each of its characters and fully immersed from beginning to end, as each decision made by the player is significant and impactful.</p>
      <p><strong>OFF</strong></p>
      <p>This game, despite having numerous flaws, tackles the premise in a way that is able to fully deliver an entertaining experience. The player's experience of the game is altered by each conflict as the story progresses to ultimately reveal the rose-tinted glasses that had been driving the player's view since the start. I enjoy games with complex stories and empathetic characters.</p>

      <h2>MOVIES</h2>
      <p><strong>Hereditary</strong></p>
      <p>This movie is one of, if not my absolute favourite horror movie of all time. It doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares or visual effects- instead captivating the viewer with its realistic portrayal of a broken family and instilling an innate sense of dread through the dynamics the film does a great job of exploring using paranormal concepts.</p>
      <p><strong>The Menu</strong></p>
      <p>This movie is not as much scary, as it is intriguing and very comedic. The film unfolds a commentary on the food service industry, and it has a little bit of everything for all viewers.</p>
